Frontend:
React (TypeScript): For interactive UI and visualizations.
Material UI: For easy, accessible, and modern component styling.
React Router: For navigation.

Backend:
FastAPI (Python): Modern, fast, and beginner-friendly web framework. Great for REST APIs and easy integration with Python DSA logic.
Pydantic: For data validation and serialization in FastAPI.

Visualization:
React-Vis: For rendering DSA visualizations in the frontend.

Communication:
REST API (JSON): FastAPI serves data and DSA operations to React via HTTP endpoints.

Development Tools:
Docker: For easy setup and deployment (optional, but recommended).
GitHub Actions: For CI/CD (optional, for learning purposes).

Testing:
Pytest (Python): For backend tests.
Jest (JavaScript): For frontend tests.

Other Recommendations:
Use Pipenv for Python dependency management.
Use Vite for React project scaffolding.

Beginner-Friendly Tips:
Keep backend and frontend in separate folders (monorepo).
Write clear documentation and comments.
Provide example DSA algorithms in Python for others to extend.
