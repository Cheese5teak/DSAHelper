Backend Setup (FastAPI)
 • Scaffold the backend using FastAPI and Pipenv for dependency management.
 • Set up basic REST endpoints for DSA operations.
 • Use Pydantic for request/response models.
 • Add example DSA algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching) in Python.

Frontend Setup (React)
 • Scaffold the frontend using Vite with React and TypeScript.
 • Install Material UI and React Router.
 • Set up basic navigation and layout.
 • Integrate React-Vis for visualizations.

API Integration
 • Connect frontend to backend via REST API (JSON).
 • Implement data fetching and display DSA visualizations.

Testing
 • Set up Pytest for backend unit tests.
 • Set up Jest for frontend tests.

Development Tools
 • Add Docker configuration for both frontend and backend (optional).
 • Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD (optional).

Documentation & Beginner-Friendly Features
 • Write clear documentation for setup, usage, and contribution.
 • Add comments and guides for extending DSA algorithms.
 • Ensure code is readable and organized.

Final Steps
 • Test the full workflow (frontend ↔ backend).
 • Deploy the project (locally or to a cloud platform).
