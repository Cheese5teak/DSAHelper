# DSAHelper

DSAHelper is an interactive web application for learning, practicing, and visualizing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Built with a beginner-friendly tech stack, it aims to help users understand DSA concepts through hands-on experimentation and visual feedback. The project is also designed for those wanting to practice Python, React, and modern web development.

## Features

- Visualize common DSA algorithms and data structures
- Interactive UI for experimenting with DSA operations
- Extendable backend for adding new algorithms in Python
- Beginner-friendly codebase and documentation

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**

- React (TypeScript)
- Material UI (component styling)
- React Router (navigation)
- React-Vis (visualizations)

**Backend:**

- FastAPI (Python)
- Pydantic (data validation)

**Communication:**

- REST API (JSON) between frontend and backend

**Development Tools:**

- Docker (optional, for easy setup and deployment)
- GitHub Actions (optional, for CI/CD)

**Testing:**

- Pytest (Python backend)
- Jest (React frontend)

**Other Recommendations:**

- Pipenv for Python dependency management
- Vite for React project scaffolding

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up the backend (Python, FastAPI, Pipenv)
3. Set up the frontend (React, Vite, Material UI)
4. Run both backend and frontend locally
5. Explore, extend, and contribute!

## Beginner-Friendly Tips

- Backend and frontend are separated for clarity
- Example DSA algorithms provided in Python
- Clear documentation and comments throughout
- Contributions and questions are welcome
